        <div class="hello">            
            <p>I am a well-rounded individual with a passion for reading, sports, and programming. As a kid, I spent
                countless hours lost in the pages of my favorite books, developing a love for the written words.
                 I am also a sports lover and enjoy playing and watching football . My
                love for sports has taught me the importance of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. In addition to
                my passion for reading and sports, I am also a skilled programmer with experience in Java full stack
                development. I am a practical and easy-going person, always looking for ways to improve my skills and
                make a positive impact in the world. I am excited to continue to learn and grow.
